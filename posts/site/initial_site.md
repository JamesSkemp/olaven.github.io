# The site
_NOTE_: This post is out of date, as the site is [updated](./how_this_site_works.md).
_NOTE_: This post was renamed from "site" to "initial site"

This is my website. I have iterated on it many times. 
Although I have made many attempts at making it look
good and stylish, I have never gotten to something that 
I like. However, my belief is that I am closer now than 
ever before.

## Styling  

My approach is simply to keep it as simple as possible. 
I am certainly not alone in this; a lot of people have 
very simple websites, focusing solely on content. We 
are talking _properly simple_. No styling or anything.
Just plain HTML-tags with content.

This means that the page fails or succeeds based on the 
cotnent alone. Because - quite frankly - content is all 
that is available. Realising that styling is not what I 
want to spend time doing, I have done something similar. 

Even if the content quality to warrant such an approach 
is not there. 

## General setup 

I am currently writing in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). 
More specifically, I am using [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx), 
which seems to combine the pleasentness of Markdowns minimal syntax 
with the usefulness of [React](reactjs.org) and its components.

For building site itself, I am using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org). 
The process has been surprisingly straightforward. Writing in
markdown and automatically receving quite nice webpages on the other 
end is a delight. The app is deployed with [now](zeit.co). I had 
some domain-related issues, but that was mainly confusion on my part.
