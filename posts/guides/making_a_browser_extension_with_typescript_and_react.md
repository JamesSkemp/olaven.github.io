# How I'm building an Extension with Typescript and React 
My goal with this guide is to show how I ended up building a chrome extension with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [react](https://reactjs.org/). It won't necessarily fit your use case. But I certainly hope you can draw inspiration from it :-) 

I've divided this post into two parts: 
1. [Why I chose the tech stack that I did](#going-with-a-comfortable-tech-stack)
2. [Showing you how to setup the project](#lets-actually-make-something)

## Going with a comfortable tech stack 
### I want the type-safety typescript can give me 
My experience is that the benefits of Typescript (or other statically typed languages) outweigh the downsides. 
I especially like how it makes refactoring much easier. 
Typescript screams at you when things are changing. Javascript silently fails. 
The former allows me to constantly search for better ways of expressing the program I'm writing without 
being afraid (too afraid) of breaking something down the line. 

### React is familiar 
Although I prefer to work on backend code, I happen to know React quite well. 
I decided to learn it sometime back in 2017, and stuck with it. When [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) were released, I transitioned into writing functional react components and I have yet to look back. I have no good explanation for why I like this. This way of writing UI and handling state just happens to work well with the way I think. 
Naturally, React was my first choice for writing a browser extension.

### Let's try to avoid bloated configuration files 
Configuration files very quickly become a mess. I find this to be escpecially true in the JS ecosystem. Before knowing it, you end up with a `.babelrc`, `webpack.config.js`, `package.json`, `<INSERT_TEST_FRAMEWORK>.config.ts`, `.eslintrc` and so on. 

This quickly becomes hard to maintain. Perhaps it shouldn't be this way, but I mostly find configuration files to be instances of "I have no idea why this works, let's not touch it". 
It's hard to debug and easy to make mistakes. Bad combination. 
([relevant comic](https://preview.redd.it/a0hf4zzwv4a11.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=0dad1c1d40783ba976a6d39f994fe423eb305dc5)) 

I landed on [Parcel](parceljs.org) which promises to need zero configuration. And I've found this to be largely true. This [might bite me some day](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/will_it_work.png), but for now I'm happy :-) 

## Let's actually make something!
Did you just skip to this section? That's fine. I'd likely have done the same. 
## Initialize and add dependencies 
We first need to initialize a new project and add the dependencies we need. 
I've written a short script with the commands below. 
It boils down to: initialize a project, and add parcel and typescript. 
```sh 
mkdir my_extension_project;
cd my_extension_project; 
yarn init -y; 
yarn add react react-dom 
yarn add --dev\
    typescript\
    parcel\
    @types/react\
    @types/react-dom\ 
    @types/chrome\ 
echo "Extension setup done üßë‚ÄçüöÄ"
```

## Simple Workflow 
This is the workflow we'll end up with: 
We want a `yarn dev` command, automatically rebuilding our source code when developing. 
We'll add a `yarn build`  command as well, for building our extension for distribution :) 

With parcel, these are very simple. Just add the following JSON configuration to the `package.json` we just created.
```json 
/*..*/
"scripts" {
    "dev": "parcel watch src/index.html --public-url=./",
    "build": "parcel build src/index.html --public-url=./"
}
/*..*/
```

You'll notice that we're referencing an `index.html` file in these scripts. 
This will be the entry point of our extension (more on this [in in a second](#add-your-first-popup)).

These commands are basically variants on "let parcel look at this file and do all the stuff Babel and Webpack would usually do".

## Popups and background scripts 
This is the time to make ourselves familiar with some extension consepts. I'll keep it short. 
### Popups are UI 
Extension popups define the GUI of our appliaction
### Background scripts are useful for interacting with the browser 


### Telling the browser about our extension
The details of the extension is defined in a `manifest.json` file at the root of our project folder. 
`manifest.json` tells the browser what our extension should have permission to do and where it's source files are.
You can [check out MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Anatomy_of_a_WebExtension#manifest.json) for further details. 

For now, let's add a `manifest.json` looking like this: 
```{
  "name": "My First Extension",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "My first browser extension!",
  "manifest_version": 2,
}
```
### Add your first popup

### Adding a background script 

## Install your extension in chrome or firefox 

## See the results! 

## See browser vendors for publishing 
I'm not going to cover how to publish your extensions here. 
This blog post covers a lot already. Browsers will have guides for this. 
[Here's one the one for Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/publish/) and [here's the same for Firefox](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/publish/submitting-an-add-on/).
