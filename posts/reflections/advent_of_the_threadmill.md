## Thoughts before 
I've been getting increasingly into riding my bike over 
the past year. From not being a very active person at 
all I'm now able to cover some moderate distances on my 
bike relatively fast. Fun! 

It's getting cold and dark. It's way below 0 degrees outside
and it will remain so for the next months. 
It also gets dark long before 
I am done with work. Cycling around town and exploring 
is fun. However I've found it hard to 
be motivated for regular exercise sessions on my bike. 

I need to try something different to stay active. 
Earlier this week I impulsively signed up for a gym 
membership for the month of December. 

I intend to give jogging on treadmills a serious go
and to create a log of my experience here. 
Treadmills are tedious and the other people at the 
gym make me a bit nervous. So why do this? 

First of all, getting out of my comfort zone is 
only good for me. Second of all, it's a project
and I enjoy having projects :) 



## Daily log 

### Day one 
I was starting to get bored. Can't let that happen!
So I impulsively signed up for a gym and thought I'd 
try jogging. 

Arrived at 19:00. The gym was larger than I expected.
Many people and loud music. On the second floor I 
found a room with no music and mostly treadmills.
Should work. 

Turned on a podcast and did on-and-off jogging for 
45-60 minutes. I'm feeling surprisingly OK, if a 
little bit bored with the static view. 

My feet got irritated and red, and quite painful.
They're obviously not used to running.


### Day two 
Arrived at 21:15, 45 minutes before closing. 
Very few people! That's great! I could pick
exactly the treadmill I wanted to, in a safe 
corner. 

Jogged on-and-off until they closed. 
I felt alright, but I found it a bit harder to 
keep up today compared to yesterday.

Jogging is clearly different from cycling!
It's much heavier in every way. Thus far 
I'm finding it harder to get into a flow. 
Hopefully this gets easier over time. 

Both of my feet developed some serious blisters.
I bought some gel plasters on the way home, 
drained the blisters and applied the plasters 
before going to bed. 


### Day three 
Unfortunately one of the blisters got really painful, 
woke me up and kept me awake several times during the 
night. No fun. I (naively?) did not expect that. 

I was set on heading to the gym, but my better 
half advised me to take one rest day and recover before 
I make things worse. She was right. 

Walking is hard after sitting still and I'm feeling 
very sore. I'm not too worried about that, I think 
my body just has to adjust to this new way of moving. 


### Day four 
I went to the gym at 20:00 and spent most 
of the upcoming hour on the treadmill. I 
was able to run for noticeably longer than 
earlier before turning to walking speeds. 

My blisters have started to heal, but are 
still very present. They're not as painful
anymore though. The soreness I felt afterwards 
moved more to the sides of my legs compared 
to earlier days. 

Later in the evening my nose started 
bleeding. This is fairly common for me, so
I'm not sure if it's connected to the running 
or not.

Interestingly this was the first night
where running on the treadmill no longer felt 
completely novel. Rather, it is approaching 
a feeling I would associate with the norm. 
Quicker than I expected! 

### Day five 
I'm finally starting to get somewhere close 
to achieving "the zone" I can get into when
riding my bike. I'm still far away, but noticeably 
less so. 

I arrived at 19:00 and did 2x10 minutes of 
jogging and then 2x5 minutes, all with relatively 
fast walking in between. This is roughly what 
I have been doing the other days as well, but 
it's starting to feel more solid and it comes 
a bit easier. 

My foot started to hit the ground a bit differently 
today. I'm wondering if this is an automated 
response to the blisters. Those haven't quite 
healed yet. The soreness is no longer painful
in the same way as before. Just present. It's 
also moved further to the sides of my legs. 

### Day six
After arriving around 15:00, I noticed 
instant pain in my foot when I started to 
run. Walking had been strange all day, but 
somehow I thought it would disappear when I 
started to run. 

Because of this I sat on an exercise 
bikes instead. This was still good exercise and 
my foot didn't hurt at all. Great! 
Riding on a still-standing bike was boring. 
I missed the road. Following the [World 
Chess Championship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Chess_Championship_2021)
helped a bunch :) 

### Day seven
In order to make some pre-arranged plans I arrived 
much earlier than I usually do. And my foot was 
fine again! No pain. So I went back to running :) 

This day went similar to [day five](#day-five). That's 
good! Day seven also feels a bit like a milestone. 
I'm not celebrating anything until the end though.  

### Day eight 
Arrived around 20:00 in the evening. 
I'd had too much to eat for dinner and clearly 
payed for that when running. 

I had slightly longer breaks of walking than 
I usually do and ran for 2x10 minutes and 1x5, which 
is 5 minutes less than the other days. 
I'm not feeling too bad about it, but I 
can return stronger next time!

### Day nine 
This evening was spent working on my bike.
That is fixing it, not riding. Being a hopeless amateur
bike mechanic is fun sometimes, but usually 
takes a lot of time. 

I also ate a lot of liquorice and drank a liter 
of chocolate milk while making dinner. 
I probably shouldn't mention this since I'm 
sort of documenting exercise, but it feels
a bit disingenuous to leave it out. 

### Day ten 
I arrived at 18:00 today. 
I did 3x10 minutes. That has become 
the "mark of success" at this point, so 
I am happy :)  

I took off the plasters earlier because 
everything looked and felt fine again. 
Unfortunately one of the blisters flared 
up again today, and I applied new ones 
as a result. 

Things felt tough when I was running, but 
when I look back at it, I feel like the time 
passed relatively quickly!

### Day eleven
Another day of 3x10 minutes! 
Running felt easier today, and 
time flew by with some fun podcasts. 

### Day twelve 
I had plans today and I did not 
have time to run after work. The plans 
involved playing padel, so at least 
some activity was involved :) 

### Day thirteen
Played padel today as well, but since 
this was a saturday I had time to run 
as well :-) I did 20 minutes of continuos 
running and then ten more after a break! 
That is the longest yet and it feels like a 
step up from the usual 3x10.

There were few people at the gym; I 
had the place almost to myself. I addition, 
getting to and from the padel court
involved some uphill cycling on 
snowy roads. What a day!

### Day fourteen 
Another day of 3x10 minutes. This was fun.
Running starts to feel very normal. I actually 
like it, more than I expected to at the very least. 

This time I was listening ot music instead of 
podcasts. This was an interesting change. I thought 
it would bore me, but my head had enough going on 
on its own. Coming to think of it, that is why I 
listen to podcasts in the first place; it makes my 
brain shut up, at least partially. 


### Day fifteen
My legs are hurting a lot. And for some reason they 
are painfully stinging when I try to get up from a 
squatting position or otherwise putting a lot of 
weight on my right knee. Not good. My foot also 
feels like it is lightly sprained. 

I think a rest day is much needed. Luckily I am practically
drowning in work to keep me occupied today. 

### Day sixteen 
I am afraid that the pain is similar to yesterday. I will
continue staying away from running. I am still cycling to work though. 
Cycling does not seem to trigger the pain. Furhthermore, it is not long 
to the office. I do not thing it will have a negative impact on my 
recovery. 

I have started doing stretching exercises. I now realize that I should 
have done this from the beginning. Obvious in hindsight. Oh well, 
at least I am learning. 

Hopefully this will get better soon.

### Day seventeen 
The pain is slowly but surely getting better :) 
I am still doing stretching exercises during the day 
and staying away from running. 

In addition to not stretching properly, I now see 
that I have not been good enough at starting slowly 
and getting properly warmed up. I have usually done 
around 2-5 minutes of walking before attempting to run. 
In hindsight that does not seem like enough. Another 
learning point I guess. 

I will keep at this resting and healing for as long 
as needed. I feel a bit sheepish for putting myself 
in this position. Again: learning the hard way :) 

### Day eighteen
My knee is getting better and so is my foot. 
There is still some pain, but nothing compared to just 
two days ago. That is great! 

I am a bit sorry this whole running thing did not go as expected. 
I really learned a lot in a short amount of time, however! 
The importance of stretching and starting slow, for 
one thing. I also learned that running is very hard on 
the body; I have not had anything close to these kinds of 
issues when cycling. 

I played padel again today and really enjoyed it. 
My legs and general soreness is holding me back a 
bit, but not enough to remove the fun from it. 


## Thoughts after 
This has been some interesting weeks. For one thing, 
I discovered that running can be alright. I also learned 
a lot about some of the mistakes one can make when 
starting out. All things I kind of thought I knew. And 
all things I was warned about by people close to me. 
This shows that I can be a bit stubborn and sometimes 
need to learn something for myself to actually understand 
and take i seriously. Although often advantageous, this 
mindset definitely has some drawbacks as well :) 

I am happy that I exposed myself to something new, made 
some mistakes and learned from it :)
