# Advent of the Treadmill

## Background 
I've been getting increasingly into riding my bike over 
the past year. From not being a very active person at 
all I'm now able to cover some moderate distances on my 
bike relatively fast. Fun! 

It's getting cold and dark. It's (and will be) way 
below 0 degrees outside and it gets dark long before 
I am done with work. Cycling around town and exploring 
is still fun. However I've found it a bit hard to 
be motivated for regular exercise sessions on my bike. 

I need to try something different to stay active. 
Earlier this week I impulsively signed up for a gym 
membership for the month of December. 

I intend to give jogging on treadmills a serious go
and to create a log of my experience here. 
Treadmills are tedious and the other people at the 
gym make me a bit nervous. So why do this? 

First of all, getting out of my comfort zone is 
only good for me. Second of all, it's a project
and I enjoy having projects :)

### Day one 
I was starting to get bored. Can't let that happen!
So I impulsively signed up for a gym and thought I'd 
try jogging. 

Arrived at 19:00. The gym was larger than I expected.
Many people and loud music. On the second floor I 
found a room with no music and mostly treadmills.
Alright, should work. 

Turned on a podcast and did on-and-off jogging for 
45-60 minutes. I'm feeling surprisingly OK, if a 
little bit bored with the static view. 

My feet got irritated and red, and quite painful.
They're obviously not used to running.


### Day two 
Arrived at 21:15, 45 minutes before closing. 
Very few people! That's great! I could pick
exactly the treadmill I wanted to, in a safe 
corner. 

Jogged on-and-off until they closed. 
I felt alright, but I found it a bit harder to 
keep up today compared to yesterday.

Jogging is clearly different from cycling!
It's much heavier in every way. Thus far 
I'm finding it harder to get into a flow. 
Hopefully this gets easier over time. 

Both of my feet developed some serious blisters.
I bought some gel plasters on the way home, 
drained the blisters and applied the plasters 
before going to bed. 


### Day three 
Unfortunately one of the blisters got really painful, 
woke me up and kept me awake several times during the 
night. No fun. I (naively?) did not expect that. 

I was set on heading to the gym, but my better 
half advised me to take one rest day and recover before 
I make things worse. She was right. 

Walking is hard after sitting still and I'm feeling 
very sore. I'm not too worried about that, I think 
my body just has to adjust to this new way of moving. 


### Day four
