# Lessons from building Krets 

I've spent most of the last 8 months on [Krets](https://krets.app). The project was 
my first real attempt at creating a commercially viable service on my own. While the project isn't dead, I have decided to take a step back and focus on other projects 
for a while. Namely [Paperpod](https://paperpod.fm). 

This post covers some of the things I I've learned while working on Krets. 

## Don't make me think! (or, frankly, do anything)
Most people, i.e. potential customers, really don't like having to figure out how to use your software.
I thought knew this after reading [Steve Krugh's _Don't make me think_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Make_Me_Think) years ago. 
I didn't. 

Krets was primarily targeted at businesses, meaning that I was talking quite a lot to owners of small businesses. 
They have a lot on their mind already. Everything not core to their business is a distraction unless 
the rewards for them materialize themselves quickly. This means: minimal setup and minimal distruption 
to their existing flow is essential. 
On several occasions, I experienced that users, even when interested in how to use the software, did not 
even want to spend the time signing up, but asked me do it.

So the lesson is: People are not going to spend time on you or your project. 
Even if they see potential value in what youre offering, they don't care until the value is actually there. 
They don't find the project in itself interesting, like you do. 

This was (still is, if I'm being honest) hard to internalize because I am 
the oposite. I am curious to learn about sotware and play around with every setting I can find. 
I guess this is why I'm the software developer in these situations. 

Also: 
Once something else has to be handled (like idk, [a pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic)) 
you're the first thing going off their todo-list. Understandably so. 

## Time is worth a lot of money 
When I started this project, I found myself with relatively little money, 
but a lot of time. Krets required a lot of skills I did not have, nor had 
the money to buy from someone else. Like marketing-, sales- and design skills. 

I thought this was OK. Money and time are just two sides of the same coin (pun intended). 
Since I had a lot of time, I could just throw that at the problem, instead of money. 
While I still believe this to be mostly true, I drastically underestimated how much 
time is required for... everything. Ironic really, since that's the one thing 
everyone tells everyone about every project ever. 

Doing everything myself and spending time gaining practical experience as a marketer,
cold-calling potential customers, organize meetings and trying to get funding has is 
an experience I am extremy happy to finally have a bit of. It just did not pay off 
for the project itself, in this limited time span. 

## Having friends is a must 
I have been working on Krets alone. However, I've been lucky to have a couple friends 
around. Dedicating time to talking about your thoughts with someone is key. Additionally, 
just having someone to talk to about what's on your mind is very helpful for separating
out the constructive and good thoughs and the messy inners of your brain. 

These sessions can be scheduled, informal lunches or a meeting with a specific topic. 
Try to make it a regular thing. The times I had this were way easier to deal with 
than the times I didn't. 


* A cool product is not enough 
* Being alone is hard, having friends is amazing 
* Most people have lots of other stuff on their mind 
* There's two ways to have progress 
  * Doing a lot of what you're good at 
  * Getting out of your comfort zone and doing new things
  * Preferrably at the same time
