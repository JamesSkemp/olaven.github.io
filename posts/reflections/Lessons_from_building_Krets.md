# Lessons from building Krets 

I've spent most of the last 8 months on [Krets](https://krets.app). The project was 
my first real attempt at creating a commercially viable service on my own, as a solo project. While the project is by no means dead, I have decided to take a step back 
and focus on other projects for a while. Namely [Paperpod](https://paperpod.fm). 

These are some of the lessons I've made while working on Krets. 

## Don't make me think! (or, frankly, do anything)
Most people, i.e. potential customers, really don't like having to figure out how to use your software. I thought knew this after reading [Steve Krugh's _Don't make me think_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Make_Me_Think) years ago. I didn't. 

* Dont make me think! 
  * most people don't care about learning software 
  * They don't want control 
  * They want things to be handled for them 

## Time is worth a lot of money 
When I started this project, I found myself with relatively little money, 
but a lot of time. Krets required a lot of skills I did not have, nor had 
the money to buy from someone else. Like marketing-, sales- and design skills. 

I thought this was OK. Money and time are just two sides of the same coin (pun intended). 
Since I had a lot of time, I could just throw that at the problem, instead of money. 
While I still believe this to be mostly true, I drastically underestimated how much 
time is required for... everything. Ironic really, since that's the one thing 
everyone tells everyone about every project ever. 

Doing everything myself and spending time gaining practical experience as a marketer,
cold-calling potential customers, organize meetings and trying to get funding has is 
an experience I am extremy happy to finally have a bit of. It just did not pay off 
for the project itself, in this limited time span. 

## Having friends is a must 

* A cool product is not enough 
* Being alone is hard, having friends is amazing 
* Most people have lots of other stuff on their mind 
* There's two ways to have progress 
  * Doing a lot of what you're good at 
  * Getting out of your comfort zone and doing new things
  * Preferrably at the same time
