# Gradual Learning 
__A strategy for overcoming needlessly scary fears.__ 

I recently acquired my first ever hammock. I am also notoriously good at 
overthinking and getting scared. My intention is to sleep in the hammock. 
Hammocks were semi-present in my childood; we always had one in the garden. 
In that sense, I find them to be safe.  

The hammock in the garden was used for leisure time. It was not a tool and never 
a bed. I don't think you could call me very handy. Sometimes I wonder if there is 
something except handling computers I am not clumsy at. Setting up a hammock 
seemed like a real challenge for me. The hammock by itself is not that scary. 
There are more elements to the hammock, once you decide to sleep in it. Setting up 
the hammock safely, getting some shelter for the wind, getting appropriate clothes, 
figuring out what to eat, learning how to lay comfortably for long stretches of time, 
so on and so forth. Let alone being able to sleep alone in the woods!
In that sense, I find them to be scary.  

While learning hwo to solve this problem, I noticed a pattern in my own actions. 
The pattern is one of "gradual learning". I will attempt to make this clear in this 
post. I think that it;s generally applicable to a lot of challenges. 

This does not sound like that much of a challenge, you may be thinking. Even 
if sleeping outside alone is scary if you're not used to it, this seems a 
bit much. This is true. However, the point is not the problem. The point is how
it was solved. 


Laere ting gradvis -> OK med smaa maal 
Bygg opp, bygg opp 

hengekeoey -> 
    tur for aa henge opp tau. OK selv om jeg ikke fant korrekte traer; det var ikke poenget
