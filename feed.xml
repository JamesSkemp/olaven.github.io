<p><em>NOTE</em>: This post is out of date, as the site is <a href="./how_this_site_works.md">updated</a>.
<em>NOTE</em>: This post was renamed from &quot;site&quot; to &quot;initial site&quot;</p>
<p>This is my website. I have iterated on it many times. 
Although I have made many attempts at making it look
good and stylish, I have never gotten to something that 
I like. However, my belief is that I am closer now than 
ever before.</p>
<h2 id="styling">Styling</h2>
<p>My approach is simply to keep it as simple as possible. 
I am certainly not alone in this; a lot of people have 
very simple websites, focusing solely on content. We 
are talking <em>properly simple</em>. No styling or anything.
Just plain HTML-tags with content.</p>
<p>This means that the page fails or succeeds based on the 
cotnent alone. Because - quite frankly - content is all 
that is available. Realising that styling is not what I 
want to spend time doing, I have done something similar. </p>
<p>Even if the content quality to warrant such an approach 
is not there. </p>
<h2 id="general-setup">General setup</h2>
<p>I am currently writing in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. 
More specifically, I am using <a href="https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx">MDX</a>, 
which seems to combine the pleasentness of Markdowns minimal syntax 
with the usefulness of <a href="reactjs.org">React</a> and its components.</p>
<p>For building site itself, I am using <a href="https://nextjs.org">NextJS</a>. 
The process has been surprisingly straightforward. Writing in
markdown and automatically receving quite nice webpages on the other 
end is a delight. The app is deployed with <a href="zeit.co">now</a>. I had 
some domain-related issues, but that was mainly confusion on my part. </p>
</description></item><item><title>how  this site works</title><link>https://olaven.org/out/about_this_site/how _this_site_works.html</link><guid>https://olaven.org/out/about_this_site/how _this_site_works.html</guid><description><h1 id="blogging-with-markblog">Blogging with <a href="www.github.com/olaven/markblog">Markblog</a></h1>
<p>Or rather: how I got rid of bloated setup and just wrote markdown. </p>
<p>When I first built this site almost a year ago, <a href="olaven.org/out/site.html">I was pretty 
happy</a> with my setup. It was built with 
<a href="https://nextjs.org/">NextJS</a>, hosted with <a href="https://zeit.co/home">Zeit now</a> and 
the pages were written in <a href="https://mdxjs.com/">MDX</a> and styled with <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>.
A pretty huge pipeline is needed in order to get this to stick together. </p>
<p>However, the site itself was literally just as basic as the site you are looking 
at right now (as of march, 2020). Why is such a complicated setup needed? Of 
course, it is not. But I knew NextJS pretty well, had gotten familiar with Sass and 
I really wanted to write using <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. 
What I wanted was achieved: a homepage I could update by writing markdown. However, I 
could not quite get past the fact that there was so much setup needed for such a basic thing.</p>
<p>Markblog is my attempt at a solution. It is a small piece of software written in <a href="deno.land">Deno</a>. 
It simply converts markdown to HTML, and packages it in a nice, tiny, non-bloated blog-like page. 
As of writing, the default file structure is as follows:  </p>
<ul>
<li><code>index.md</code></li>
<li><code>style.css</code></li>
<li><code>posts/</code></li>
</ul>
<p>(create this automatically with Markblog&#39;s <code>init</code>-command)</p>
<p>The index page shows the markdown-text in addition to links to posts, in addition to the content 
written in <code>index.md</code>. Then, Markblog&#39;s <code>build</code>-command triggers conversion to html. In my setup, 
this runs as part of a simple CI-pipeline, meaning that I never touch anything other than Markdown-files. </p>

<p><em>Disclaimer</em>: parts of this guide covers a piece of software called Markblog, of which I am the author.</p>
<h2 id="who-is-this-for">Who is this for?</h2>
<p>This guide assumes that you are: </p>
<ul>
<li>familiar with using the command line</li>
<li>familiar with using <code>git</code></li>
<li>someone with a basic understanding of Markdown</li>
<li>a Github user (üëã or <a href="https://github.com/join">become one</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whats-this-guide-about">What&#39;s this guide about?</h2>
<p>This guide will go through an easy way to get setup a blog. Afterwards, you 
will be able to blog with the following workflow: </p>
<ol>
<li>write markdown-files on your computer ‚úçÔ∏è</li>
<li>push your prose to github üêô</li>
<li>have your blog update automatically üòç</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="whats-the-techstack-briefly">What&#39;s the techstack, briefly?</h2>
<p>To build our blog from Markdown, we will use <a href="https://github.com/olaven/markblog">Markblog</a>. 
This is an open source tool written with <a href="deno.land">Deno</a>. </p>
<p>In order to deploy our website, we will use <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. Github Pages 
is free and works - unsurprisingly - seamlessly with projects on Github. 
Additionally, <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">Github Actions</a> will be used to automate the 
deployment process. If these tools are unfamiliar, this might seem like a lot. But stick with me, 
it is all relatively simple when it comes together üòÖ</p>
<h2 id="enough-talk-lets-get-started">Enough talk, let&#39;s get started!</h2>
<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://git-scm.com/">install Git</a></li>
<li><a href="https://deno.land/#install">install Deno</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/olaven/markblog#installation">install Markblog</a></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="git-setup">Git Setup</h3>
<ol>
<li>create a repository on Github (check &quot;Initialize this repository with a README&quot;)</li>
<li>Enable &quot;Github Pages&quot; in the repository settings by setting <code>master</code> as source. </li>
<li>navigate to some fitting folder in your terminal, e.g. <code>cd $HOME/Documents</code></li>
<li>clone your new repo with <code>git clone https://github.com/&lt;your-username&gt;/&lt;your-repository-name&gt;</code></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="blog-setup">Blog Setup</h3>
<ol>
<li>navigate to your cloned repository with <code>cd &lt;your-repository-name&gt;</code></li>
<li>run <code>markblog init</code></li>
<li>(optional) add <code>./style.css</code> to make your page look the way you want</li>
</ol>
<p>Markblog has created two files for you: <code>index.md</code> and <code>./posts</code>. 
Anything you write in <code>index.md</code> will appear on the front-page of your blog. 
<code>./posts</code> is where you will write new posts on your blog. </p>
<h3 id="writing-your-first-post">Writing your first post</h3>
<p>Let&#39;s take a break from the setup, and write something!</p>
<ol>
<li>open the repo-folder in your text editor of choice</li>
<li>in <code>index.md</code>, write a sentence or two about the blog. Or don&#39;t - it&#39;s up to you ü§ó</li>
<li>create a new file in <code>./posts</code> called <code>my_first_post.md</code>. </li>
<li>Write something in <code>./posts/my_first_post.md</code>. Or don&#39;t - still up to you üç®</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="automated-deployment">Automated Deployment</h3>
<p>After this step, we will have achieved the workflow outlined <a href="#whats-this-guide-about">at the beginning</a>!
This section is long and somewhat cumbersome. However, this is automation! In other words,
we only have to do this once!</p>
<ul>
<li>On <a href="https://github.com">Github</a><ol>
<li>Go to your <a href="https://github.com/settings/profile">profile settings</a></li>
<li>Navigate to &quot;Developer settings&quot; -&gt; &quot;Personal access tokens&quot; </li>
<li>click &quot;Generate new access token&quot;. This will prompt for your password.</li>
<li>Make sure to check &quot;repo&quot;-access, write a fitting note and click &quot;Generate token&quot;</li>
<li>Keep the token until step 8. Never share it!</li>
<li>head over to the repository you created</li>
<li>Navigate to &quot;Settings&quot; -&gt; &quot;Secrets&quot; and click &quot;Add a new secret&quot;</li>
<li>Add a secret called <code>ACCESS_TOKEN</code>, with the key from step 4.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Locally, in your cloned repository<ol>
<li>create directory for Github Actions with <code>mkdir -p ./github/workflows</code>. </li>
<li>create a workflow-file for deploy with <code>touch ./github/workflows/deploy.yml</code></li>
<li>paste the following into <code>deploy.yml</code>: </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<p>I want to create a theme for myself. Some do this for a year. I am not sure if a year is the correct amount of time. 
Years are so engrained in everything, and they are everywhere. I think coupling a theme with a year would create 
unnecessary levels of stress when the year is coming to a close. 
And stress is not something that I want. </p>
<p>The idea of themes come - as far as I‚Äôm concerned - from CGP Grey and Myke Hurley on the the <a href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex">Cortex podcast</a>. 
Although comparable to a new years resolution, a theme is more broad. Myke described it as ‚Äúa north star‚Äù while Grey thought 
of it as a ‚Äú<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)">Daemon</a> process for the brain‚Äù (both paraphrased from memory). </p>
<p>In addition to being more broad, there is no fail state. Themes may change or turn out to be wrong. 
That‚Äôs not failure. On the contrary, it‚Äôs an achievement. It is recognising one was mistaken, and 
attempting to make adjustments in time. </p>
<p>I believe this comes from their less concrete and broad nature. New years resolutions are paths that must
be followed. Themes are just lighting up the different paths ahead of you. </p>
<p>So - creation. What do I mean by that? I am not sure, but I am writing to find out. 
What follows is a description of my starting point. </p>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>I am coming close to finishing my bachelors degree, and I do not yet have any concrete plans for what to do next. 
The past two and a half years I have been very focused on studies. That was a deliberate decision, and I am happy it was made. 
The past two and a half years have been the best of my youth/adult life. </p>
<p>What made them great? I never quite came to terms with high school. I started to study right after leaving the place.
A major quality of life improvement after the change was that i finally had gained control of my own time. 
I still had (have) to attend some lectures during the week, but just the fact that no one makes me go there 
(i.e. there is no punishment for not going) makes <em>all</em> the difference. In addition, lectures only make up ~8 hours 
every week, meaning that a large majority of the time is spent exactly as I see fit. This allows customisation of my 
work environment on a level that I have previously only been able to dream of. </p>
<p>I have also tried myself down the path of consulting and self employment; a bumpy, but enjoyable ride that I think has a 
lot of potential, given attention and a thoughtful approach. </p>
<p>During this time, I have had relatively clear goals in mind. Wether it was getting a job, getting good grades, 
getting experience being self employed or getting the bachelors degree. </p>
<p>With one exception, these goals have been reached. I still have half a year to - hopefully - get the degree. 
I am relieved that things have mostly gone my way. I have to find new goals. Goals keep me going and give me some 
sense of purpose. But that presupposes that the goals are good. Good goals brings purpose, bad ones do not. </p>
<h2 id="creation">Creation</h2>
<p>I have been told that I seem most happy when I have projects that I am working on, and when I am creating things. 
This is a false perception, though not strictly untrue. I would not say that I become happy. Rather, I become engaged. 
Engagement is keeping me away from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apathy">apathy</a>, which in turn would make me unhappy. </p>
<p>My largest problem going forward is figuring out what to do after getting my bachelors degree. That struggle is not 
what this write-up is about. However, the theme is probably going to affect the way I view my options going forward 
and therefore relevant. I want to be self-driven, and I want to create something that I believe has inherent value. </p>
<p>In fact, I have some unexplainable urge to do something and express myself. Some people describe some irrational 
need to express themselves. I‚Äôm not sure it is irrational. It is more appropriate to call it moment-driven. And I want more of it. This is a real aspect of me, but it is sometimes neglected. 
The other part of me wants to make the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù and ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù choices. The safe choice, that will guarantee a stable future. 
These two parts are in conflict with each other. I need them not to be. </p>
<p>These parts have strengths and weaknesses. The rational ‚Äúplay safe‚Äù-part of me should be allowed to dominate sometimes. 
During the time leading up to an exam or making me go through slides before the lecture. </p>
<p>The latter part has a tendency to dominate, and that has often been a huge benefit. But the moment-driven part of me 
is responsible for some decisions that I am very happy with. For example, studying Computer Science at a private university 
college known for being alternative and ‚Äúcreative‚Äù. This went agains almost all the advice I received, urging me towards a 
public, safe university. However, I am almost certain that I made the correct choice. Trusting some gut feeling has worked 
for me at times when the path has not been clear.</p>
<p>When goals are clear (e.g. before an upcoming exam), I <em>should</em> make reasonable and safe decisions. But without the clear 
goal, ‚Äúwant to‚Äù may be wiser than ‚Äúshould‚Äù. The difficulty lies in figuring out when to follow what side. As I am starting 
to lack concrete goals, I believe that I am at a similar point now. I should repeat the success I achieved when choosing between schools. </p>
<p>The difficult part about moment-driven side is that is is very unpredictable. It surfaces from time to time, and usually 
gives good insight. It may in fact give new goals. This is the reason I want to chase it in the upcoming season. </p>
<p>But how am I to chase it? How can it be provoked? I have to deviate slightly from the safe paths, and allow myself to 
focus on following the urges more than I have been doing in the past. And I think this can be done through creation. 
‚ÄúCreation‚Äù is a broad term. 
Specifically, I am referring to the act of making things that feel meaningful to me at the time of creation, without 
necessarily thinking in the long term. </p>
<p>The bachelor project I will be working on is a large project, but it is just <em>one</em> project. My guess is that this will 
allow me to focus on more things as well, regardless of the bachelor projects size. Hopefully, I will have more space in my brain. </p>
<p>Exploration through creation is the key of the theme, in search of new goals. </p>
<h2 id="concretely">Concretely</h2>
<p>Themes are meant to guide, not dictate. My plan going forward is to create what I want when I want to. 
And seek opportunities for creation. </p>
<ul>
<li>Whims should be embraced before being criticised. </li>
<li>Exploration should be encouraged, also when doing school work. </li>
<li>Follow the moment-driven urges to create when it surfaces. </li>
<li>Creations should be valued, regardless of career and academic value </li>
</ul>
<p>Reaching new goals is the purpose, and this is an attempt at an approach.   </p>
