# Olav Sundf√∏r - @olaven
- I enjoy thinking about- and working on different things in parallel. 
- I strive to have an intentional and structured approach to my time. 
- I like to ride my bike. 
- I enjoy freelancing as a software developer (experienced fullstack developer)
- I am taking courses in language and culture at the [University of Utrecht](https://www.uu.nl/). 
- I occasionally work on various open source projects, like [paperpod.fm](https://github.com/olaven/paperpod) and [Markblog](https://github.com/olaven/markblog). (The latter is running this page!)
