# Olav Sundf√∏r - @olaven
- I enjoy thinking about- and working on _different things in parallel_. 
- I strive to have an _intentional_ and structured approach to my time. 
- I like to _ride my bike_. 
- I enjoy _freelancing as a software developer_ ([experienced fullstack developer](./assets/documents/CV.pdf))
- I occasionally work on various _open source projects_, like [paperpod.fm](https://github.com/olaven/paperpod) and [Markblog](https://github.com/olaven/markblog). (The latter is running this page!)
