# Olav Sundf√∏r - @olaven
I'm a programmer currently working [@enode](https://enode.io). 
From time to time, I also work on [paperpod.fm](https://github.com/olaven/paperpod). 
I also wrote a super-simple blogging engine called [Markblog](https://github.com/olaven/markblog). It's running this page :) 

Other times, I'm: 
* getting better at cycling
* learning new stuff
* doing occasional freelance-work
