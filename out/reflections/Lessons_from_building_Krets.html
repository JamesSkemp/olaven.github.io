<h2 id="trying-to-create-a-profitable-project-alone">Trying to create a profitable project alone</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve spent most of my time between summer and christmas 2020 working on <a href="https://krets.app">Krets</a>. The project was 
my first real attempt at creating a commercially viable service on my own. While the project isn&#39;t dead, I&#39;ve now started focusing on other projects for a while. </p>
<p>This post covers some of the things I I&#39;ve learned while working on Krets. </p>
<h2 id="dont-make-me-think-or-frankly-do-anything">Don&#39;t make me think! (or, frankly, do anything)</h2>
<p>Most people, i.e. potential customers, really don&#39;t like having to figure out how to use your software.
I thought knew this after reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Make_Me_Think">Steve Krugh&#39;s <em>Don&#39;t make me think</em></a> years ago. 
I didn&#39;t. </p>
<p>Krets was primarily targeted at businesses, meaning that I&#39;ve been talking a lot to owners of small businesses. 
They have a lot on their mind already. Everything not core to their business is a distraction unless 
the rewards for them materialize themselves quickly. This means: minimal setup and minimal distruption 
to their existing flow is essential. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve experienced potential customers don&#39;t even want to spend the time to create an account, but would 
rather have me do it. These were otherwise excited customers who showed initiative. 
This happened on several occations. </p>
<p>So the lesson is: People are not going to spend time on you or your project. 
Even if they see value in what you&#39;re offering, they don&#39;t care until the value is actually there. 
They don&#39;t find the project in itself interesting, like you do. </p>
<p>This was (still is, if I&#39;m being honest) hard to internalize because I am 
the oposite. I am curious to learn about software and play around with every user-setting I can find. 
I guess that&#39;s why I ended up writing software.</p>
<p>Also, if something else has to be handled (like idk, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">a pandemic</a>) 
you&#39;re the first thing going off their todo-list. Understandably so :)</p>
<h2 id="time-is-worth-a-lot-of-money">Time is worth a lot of money</h2>
<p>When I started this project, I found myself with relatively little money, 
but a lot of time. Krets required a lot of skills I did not have, nor had 
the money to buy from someone else. Like marketing-, sales- and design skills. </p>
<p>I thought this was OK. Money and time are just two sides of the same coin. 
Since I had a lot of it, I could just throw time at the problem, instead of money. 
While I still believe this to be mostly true, I drastically underestimated how much 
time is required for... everything. Ironic really, since that&#39;s the one thing 
everyone tells everyone about every project ever. </p>
<p>I did everything: marketing, cold-calling potential customers, organize meetings and try to get funding, 
as well as actually implementing the product. </p>
<p>I&#39;m very happy to have this experience of being responsible for- and doing everything.
It just did not pay off for the project this time :-) </p>
<h2 id="having-friends-is-a-must">Having friends is a must</h2>
<p>I have been working on Krets alone. However, I&#39;ve been lucky to have a couple friends 
around. Dedicating time to talking about your thoughts with someone is key. 
Having someone to talk to about what&#39;s on your mind is very helpful for separating
out the constructive and good thoughs from the messy inners of your brain. </p>
<p>These sessions can be scheduled, informal lunches or a meeting with a specific topic. 
Try to make it a regular thing. The times I did this were way easier to deal with 
than the times where I didn&#39;t. </p>
<h2 id="thank-you-for-reading-this">Thank you for reading this</h2>
<p>I hope these thoughts can be of help for someone else. <br/>
Regardless, thank you for taking the time to read. <br/>
Blogging is a strange beast that I&#39;m still trying to figure out. <br/></p>
