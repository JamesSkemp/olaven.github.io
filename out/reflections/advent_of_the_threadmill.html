<h2 id="thoughts-before">Thoughts before</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve been getting increasingly into riding my bike over 
the past year. From not being a very active person at 
all I&#39;m now able to cover some moderate distances on my 
bike relatively fast. Fun! </p>
<p>It&#39;s getting cold and dark. It&#39;s way below 0 degrees outside
and it will remain so for the next months. 
It also gets dark long before 
I am done with work. Cycling around town and exploring 
is fun. However I&#39;ve found it hard to 
be motivated for regular exercise sessions on my bike. </p>
<p>I need to try something different to stay active. 
Earlier this week I impulsively signed up for a gym 
membership for the month of December. </p>
<p>I intend to give jogging on treadmills a serious go
and to create a log of my experience here. 
Treadmills are tedious and the other people at the 
gym make me a bit nervous. So why do this? </p>
<p>First of all, getting out of my comfort zone is 
only good for me. Second of all, it&#39;s a project
and I enjoy having projects :) </p>
<h2 id="daily-log">Daily log</h2>
<h3 id="day-one">Day one</h3>
<p>I was starting to get bored. Can&#39;t let that happen!
So I impulsively signed up for a gym and thought I&#39;d 
try jogging. </p>
<p>Arrived at 19:00. The gym was larger than I expected.
Many people and loud music. On the second floor I 
found a room with no music and mostly treadmills.
Should work. </p>
<p>Turned on a podcast and did on-and-off jogging for 
45-60 minutes. I&#39;m feeling surprisingly OK, if a 
little bit bored with the static view. </p>
<p>My feet got irritated and red, and quite painful.
They&#39;re obviously not used to running.</p>
<h3 id="day-two">Day two</h3>
<p>Arrived at 21:15, 45 minutes before closing. 
Very few people! That&#39;s great! I could pick
exactly the treadmill I wanted to, in a safe 
corner. </p>
<p>Jogged on-and-off until they closed. 
I felt alright, but I found it a bit harder to 
keep up today compared to yesterday.</p>
<p>Jogging is clearly different from cycling!
It&#39;s much heavier in every way. Thus far 
I&#39;m finding it harder to get into a flow. 
Hopefully this gets easier over time. </p>
<p>Both of my feet developed some serious blisters.
I bought some gel plasters on the way home, 
drained the blisters and applied the plasters 
before going to bed. </p>
<h3 id="day-three">Day three</h3>
<p>Unfortunately one of the blisters got really painful, 
woke me up and kept me awake several times during the 
night. No fun. I (naively?) did not expect that. </p>
<p>I was set on heading to the gym, but my better 
half advised me to take one rest day and recover before 
I make things worse. She was right. </p>
<p>Walking is hard after sitting still and I&#39;m feeling 
very sore. I&#39;m not too worried about that, I think 
my body just has to adjust to this new way of moving. </p>
<h3 id="day-four">Day four</h3>
<p>I went to the gym at 20:00 and spent most 
of the upcoming hour on the treadmill. I 
was able to run for noticeably longer than 
earlier before turning to walking speeds. </p>
<p>My blisters have started to heal, but are 
still very present. They&#39;re not as painful
anymore though. The soreness I felt afterwards 
moved more to the sides of my legs compared 
to earlier days. </p>
<p>Later in the evening my nose started 
bleeding. This is fairly common for me, so
I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s connected to the running 
or not.</p>
<p>Interestingly this was the first night
where running on the treadmill no longer felt 
completely novel. Rather, it is approaching 
a feeling I would associate with the norm. 
Quicker than I expected! </p>
<h3 id="day-five">Day five</h3>
<p>I&#39;m finally starting to get somewhere close 
to achieving &quot;the zone&quot; I can get into when
riding my bike. I&#39;m still far away, but noticeably 
less so. </p>
<p>I arrived at 19:00 and did 2x10 minutes of 
jogging and then 2x5 minutes, all with relatively 
fast walking in between. This is roughly what 
I have been doing the other days as well, but 
it&#39;s starting to feel more solid and it comes 
a bit easier. </p>
<p>My foot started to hit the ground a bit differently 
today. I&#39;m wondering if this is an automated 
response to the blisters. Those haven&#39;t quite 
healed yet. The soreness is no longer painful
in the same way as before. Just present. It&#39;s 
also moved further to the sides of my legs. </p>
<h3 id="day-six">Day six</h3>
<p>After arriving around 15:00, I noticed 
instant pain in my foot when I started to 
run. Walking had been strange all day, but 
somehow I thought it would disappear when I 
started to run. </p>
<p>Because of this I sat on an exercise 
bikes instead. This was still good exercise and 
my foot didn&#39;t hurt at all. Great! 
Riding on a still-standing bike was boring. 
I missed the road. Following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Chess_Championship_2021">World 
Chess Championship</a>
helped a bunch :) </p>
<h3 id="day-seven">Day seven</h3>
<p>In order to make some pre-arranged plans I arrived 
much earlier than I usually do. And my foot was 
fine again! No pain. So I went back to running :) </p>
<p>This day went similar to <a href="#day-five">day five</a>. That&#39;s 
good! Day seven also feels a bit like a milestone. 
I&#39;m not celebrating anything until the end though.  </p>
<h3 id="day-eight">Day eight</h3>
<p>Arrived around 20:00 in the evening. 
I&#39;d had too much to eat for dinner and clearly 
payed for that when running. </p>
<p>I had slightly longer breaks of walking than 
I usually do and ran for 2x10 minutes and 1x5, which 
is 5 minutes less than the other days. 
I&#39;m not feeling too bad about it, but I 
can return stronger next time!</p>
<h3 id="day-nine">Day nine</h3>
<p>This evening was spent working on my bike.
That is fixing it, not riding. Being a hopeless amateur
bike mechanic is fun sometimes, but usually 
takes a lot of time. </p>
<p>I also ate a lot of liquorice and drank a liter 
of chocolate milk while making dinner. 
I probably shouldn&#39;t mention this since I&#39;m 
sort of documenting exercise, but it feels
a bit disingenuous to leave it out. </p>
<h3 id="day-ten">Day ten</h3>
<p>I arrived at 18:00 today. 
I did 3x10 minutes. That has become 
the &quot;mark of success&quot; at this point, so 
I am happy :)  </p>
<p>I took off the plasters earlier because 
everything looked and felt fine again. 
Unfortunately one of the blisters flared 
up again today, and I applied new ones 
as a result. </p>
<p>Things felt tough when I was running, but 
when I look back at it, I feel like the time 
passed relatively quickly!</p>
<h3 id="day-eleven">Day eleven</h3>
<p>Another day of 3x10 minutes! 
Running felt easier today, and 
time flew by with some fun podcasts. </p>
<h3 id="day-twelve">Day twelve</h3>
<p>I had plans today and I did not 
have time to run after work. The plans 
involved playing padel, so at least 
some activity was involved :) </p>
<h3 id="day-thirteen">Day thirteen</h3>
<p>Played padel today as well, but since 
this was a saturday I had time to run 
as well :-) I did 20 minutes of continuos 
running and then ten more after a break! 
That is the longest yet and it feels like a 
step up from the usual 3x10.</p>
<p>There were few people at the gym; I 
had the place almost to myself. I addition, 
getting to and from the padel court
involved some uphill cycling on 
snowy roads. What a day!</p>
<h3 id="day-fourteen">Day fourteen</h3>
<p>Another day of 3x10 minutes. This was fun.
Running starts to feel very normal. I actually 
like it, more than I expected to at the very least. </p>
<p>This time I was listening ot music instead of 
podcasts. This was an interesting change. I thought 
it would bore me, but my head had enough going on 
on its own. Coming to think of it, that is why I 
listen to podcasts in the first place; it makes my 
brain shut up, at least partially. </p>
<h3 id="day-fifteen">Day fifteen</h3>
<p>My legs are hurting a lot. And for some reason they 
are painfully stinging when I try to get up from a 
squatting position or otherwise putting a lot of 
weight on my right knee. Not good. My foot also 
feels like it is lightly sprained. </p>
<p>I think a rest day is much needed. Luckily I am practically
drowning in work to keep me occupied today. </p>
<h3 id="day-sixteen">Day sixteen</h3>
<p>I am afraid that the pain is similar to yesterday. I will
continue staying away from running. I am still cycling to work though. 
Cycling does not seem to trigger the pain. Furhthermore, it is not long 
to the office. I do not thing it will have a negative impact on my 
recovery. </p>
<p>I have started doing stretching exercises. I now realize that I should 
have done this from the beginning. Obvious in hindsight. Oh well, 
at least I am learning. </p>
<p>Hopefully this will get better soon.</p>
<h3 id="day-seventeen">Day seventeen</h3>
<p>The pain is slowly but surely getting better :) 
I am still doing stretching exercises during the day 
and staying away from running. </p>
<p>In addition to not stretching properly, I now see 
that I have not been good enough at starting slowly 
and getting properly warmed up. I have usually done 
around 2-5 minutes of walking before attempting to run. 
In hindsight that does not seem like enough. Another 
learning point I guess. </p>
<p>I will keep at this resting and healing for as long 
as needed. I feel a bit sheepish for putting myself 
in this position. Again: learning the hard way :) </p>
<h3 id="day-eighteen">Day eighteen</h3>
<p>My knee is getting better and so is my foot. 
There is still some pain, but nothing compared to just 
two days ago. That is great! </p>
<p>I am a bit sorry this whole running thing did not go as expected. 
I really learned a lot in a short amount of time, however! 
The importance of stretching and starting slow, for 
one thing. I also learned that running is very hard on 
the body; I have not had anything close to these kinds of 
issues when cycling. </p>
<p>I played padel again today and really enjoyed it. 
My legs and general soreness is holding me back a 
bit, but not enough to remove the fun from it. </p>
<h2 id="thoughts-after">Thoughts after</h2>
<p>This has been some interesting weeks. For one thing, 
I discovered that running can be alright. I also learned 
a lot about some of the mistakes one can make when 
starting out. All things I kind of thought I knew. And 
all things I was warned about by people close to me. 
This shows that I can be a bit stubborn and sometimes 
need to learn something for myself to actually understand 
and take i seriously. Although often advantageous, this 
mindset definitely has some drawbacks as well :) </p>
<p>I am happy that I exposed myself to something new, made 
some mistakes and learned from it :) </p>
