<p><em>NOTE</em>: This post is out of date, as the site is <a href="./how_this_site_works.md">updated</a>.
<em>NOTE</em>: This post was renamed from &quot;site&quot; to &quot;initial site&quot;</p>
<p>This is my website. I have iterated on it many times. 
Although I have made many attempts at making it look
good and stylish, I have never gotten to something that 
I like. However, my belief is that I am closer now than 
ever before.</p>
<h2 id="styling">Styling</h2>
<p>My approach is simply to keep it as simple as possible. 
I am certainly not alone in this; a lot of people have 
very simple websites, focusing solely on content. We 
are talking <em>properly simple</em>. No styling or anything.
Just plain HTML-tags with content.</p>
<p>This means that the page fails or succeeds based on the 
cotnent alone. Because - quite frankly - content is all 
that is available. Realising that styling is not what I 
want to spend time doing, I have done something similar. </p>
<p>Even if the content quality to warrant such an approach 
is not there. </p>
<h2 id="general-setup">General setup</h2>
<p>I am currently writing in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. 
More specifically, I am using <a href="https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx">MDX</a>, 
which seems to combine the pleasentness of Markdowns minimal syntax 
with the usefulness of <a href="reactjs.org">React</a> and its components.</p>
<p>For building site itself, I am using <a href="https://nextjs.org">NextJS</a>. 
The process has been surprisingly straightforward. Writing in
markdown and automatically receving quite nice webpages on the other 
end is a delight. The app is deployed with <a href="zeit.co">now</a>. I had 
some domain-related issues, but that was mainly confusion on my part. </p>
