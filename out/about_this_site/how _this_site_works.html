<p>Or rather: how I got rid of bloated setup and just wrote markdown. </p>
<p>When I first built this site almost a year ago, <a href="olaven.org/out/site.html">I was pretty 
happy</a> with my setup. It was built with 
<a href="https://nextjs.org/">NextJS</a>, hosted with <a href="https://zeit.co/home">Zeit now</a> and 
the pages were written in <a href="https://mdxjs.com/">MDX</a> and styled with <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>.
A pretty huge pipeline is needed in order to get this to stick together. </p>
<p>However, the site itself was literally just as basic as the site you are looking 
at right now (as of march, 2020). Why is such a complicated setup needed? Of 
course, it is not. But I knew NextJS pretty well, had gotten familiar with Sass and 
I really wanted to write using <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. 
What I wanted was achieved: a homepage I could update by writing markdown. However, I 
could not quite get past the fact that there was so much setup needed for such a basic thing.</p>
<p>Markblog is my attempt at a solution. It is a small piece of software written in <a href="deno.land">Deno</a>. 
It simply converts markdown to HTML, and packages it in a nice, tiny, non-bloated blog-like page. 
As of writing, the default file structure is as follows:  </p>
<ul>
<li><code>index.md</code></li>
<li><code>style.css</code></li>
<li><code>posts/</code></li>
</ul>
<p>(create this automatically with Markblog&#39;s <code>init</code>-command)</p>
<p>The index page shows the markdown-text in addition to links to posts, in addition to the content 
written in <code>index.md</code>. Then, Markblog&#39;s <code>build</code>-command triggers conversion to html. In my setup, 
this runs as part of a simple CI-pipeline, meaning that I never touch anything other than Markdown-files. </p>
